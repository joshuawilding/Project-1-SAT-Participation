##  Project 1: ACT/SAT Scores by State

This was my first project during General Assembly Data Science Immersive. The point of this project was to explore a dataset containing ACT and SAT scores and participation rates by state. I then created a  5-7 minute non-technical presentation for executives at the College Board, which administers the SAT, and gave them recommendations for how to increase participation for their test.

I started this project during the second week of the course, so at the time I had just learned about Pandas, NumPy, as SciPy, as well as Python visualization tools such as Seaborn and MatPlotLib.
